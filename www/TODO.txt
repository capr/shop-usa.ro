FLASHBUGS
- category div sometimes dissapears when going back to browsing
- forgot pass link -> trigger usr event


FLASHFEATS
----------
- facebook like button on the page header
- homepage banner slider
- use fa icons for grid/list


HOT FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------
- homepage custom bands
	- add-to-homepage button
	- homepage product list widget
- footer brand marquee
- top navbar: search, logheaza-te, cart
- implement _escaped_fragment_



USABILITY BUGS (CONFUSIONS)
---------------------------
- brand page shows category tree but people expect to see products
- scroll doesn't follow if screen is to small. solutions:
	- get antiscroll
	- make font smaller
	- leave it as it is
	- put less items on the page on small screens
- brand list ordering (vert-horiz instead of horiz-vert)
- informatii despre pret (contine sau nu TVA sau transport) - astea ar trebui scrise undeva in header/footer (gen "preturile afisate sunt cele finale')
- textul de la pastreaza mai tarziu (ala mic si gri) nu e suficient de vizibil
- bulina cu pastrate pt. mai tarziu
- google fucking analytics keeps the spinning wheel turning as usual...
- preserve div height when browsing gallery images to prevent flicker
- order history: show order status and per-item status, especially "canceled"
- order: warn if shipping cost is not standard when saving

HARD BUGS
---------
- notify is not centered on site, but on screen
- IE9 and history.js (very few IE9 users, but a lot of IE8 users)
- browser scrolls immediately after url_changed but content not yet loaded
	- the scroll position is adjusted afterwards, but the jerkiness is annoying


FUNCTIONALITY
-------------
- user list: check/uncheck admin
- checkout: list of addresses from past orders
- search
- filters
- sorting


NICE-TO-HAVES
-------------
- afisare ultimele produse vizualizate
- promo codes (apply % discount)
- db reporting tool:
	- parametrized
	- recursive master-detail
- better checkout experience:
	- one-column order form?
	- labels & inputs closer together
	- placeholders everywhere!
	- hide everything distracting on checkout?
	- explain why a field is needed in error messages
	- breadcrumb "Cart > Checkout" ?
	- better thank you page (user might feel generous after placing an order):
		- newsletter widget
		- facebook like button
- abandoned cart email


REDESIGN
--------
- rethink events so that they can be rebound and canceled all at once
	- ajax
	- listen
	- setTimeout, setInterval
	- keydown
