FRAMEWORK
---------
- language filter: short forms
	- <anytag:en> ... </anytag>
	- attr:en=val attr:ro=val ...


BIG BUGS
--------
- implement _escaped_fragment_
- IE9 and history.js (very few IE9 users, but a lot of IE8 users)
- move to/from cart: first item doesn't move


USABILITY BUGS (CONFUSIONS)
---------------------------
- transfer cart only if there's anything to transfer,
	otherwise don't clear the dest. cart
- login screen: better separation between left and right side
- brand page shows category tree but people expect to see products
- scroll doesn't follow if screen is to small. solutions:
	- get antiscroll
	- make font smaller
	- leave it as it is
	- put less items on the page on small screens
- no error message on create account failure
- no error message on login failure


UI BUGS
-------
- category div sometimes dissapears when going back to browsing
- scroll changes on back-button from prod page back to browsing page


FUNCTIONALITY
-------------
- account: list of past orders
- checkout: list of addresses from past orders
- place order: receive email

DESIGN
